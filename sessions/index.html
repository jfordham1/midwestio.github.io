            <div class="schedule-abstract">
              <p>In this talk, I will present detailed technical descriptions of specific processes we have developed for extremely fast client and server side mobile development at the scale of LinkedIn.
              </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Fast build, develop, test, release and monitor processes</li>
              <li>Screen based JSON for client side rendering and effortless server controlled A/B testing and bug fixes across multiple mobile platforms</li>
              <li>Screen based automation testing on the client for automated release validation</li>
              <li>Client side feature flag based trunk development model</li>
              <li>Train model based release process for native apps</li>
              <li>Fast and reliable VCR based route tests on the server (commit to production within hours)</li>
              <li>Automated monitoring like crash log analysis and staged rollouts across dimensions like client/os versions</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Most of the processes I will talk about will have live demos or sample code. All of them are currently used in production and I will have real-world examples/statistics to back up my material. I believe that attendees will walk out of this session armed with practical solutions to most of the major hurdles that large scale mobile development involves. LinkedIn is one of the biggest mobile deployments and I want to share our techniques that we have refined in the last two years that can benefit the community at large. This session is targeted to mobile engineers/developers in small to mid-size establishments who are rapidly growing their mobile presence on any mobile platform.</p>

            <div class="schedule-abstract">
              <p>Julia is a new dynamically-typed language for technical computing. While it uses types for many things, type checking is not one of them. TypeCheck.jl is a Julia package for when you want static type checking; it collects static-analysis functions that look for common problems in your code: problems that can cause run-time errors or reduced efficiency. TypeCheck.jl's type analysis uses the compiler's type-inference, so it's never out of sync with how your code is being compiled.</p>

            <div class="schedule-abstract">
              <p>When Facebook needed to scale millions of lines of legacy PHP code, rewriting everything in another language wasn't an option. Instead, they created the HHVM JIT compiler, and the HipHop PHP-to-C++ compiler before it, as drop-in replacements for the standard PHP interpreter. As an open-source project, HHVM has matured considerably over the past year and has now become a viable option for use outside of Facebook. However, the goal wasn't just to make PHP run faster. In March, Facebook open-sourced Hack, a reimagined version of PHP with a host of features borrowed from other languages (e.g. explicit typing, first-class collections, generics, and async capabilities). This session will take a look at what HHVM and Hack bring to the table for those working with PHP today.</p>

              <p>The MapReduce framework is a proven method for processing large volumes of data but even simple problems require expertise. Tackling the learning curve for Big Data and efficient processing is a daunting task for developers just getting started. The Apache Crunch project helps to break down complex processing problems into simple concepts which can be utilized on industry standard frameworks such as Hadoop and Spark. Apache Crunch is being used as an integral part of building processing pipelines for healthcare data allowing for quick development of new solutions and architectures. The talk will also cover how the core concepts of Apache Crunch enable first class integration, rapid scaling of development across teams, and development of extensible processing infrastructure.</p>

            <div class="schedule-abstract">
              <p>Our deployment infrastructure must keep pace with our business. Users expect rapid innovation and quick response to bugs or they seek out alternatives, especially on the web. The product team at our company deploys ten or more times a day, but that’s not fast enough. For us, faster deploys mean faster innovation. We tweak and deploy new features repeatedly, searching for the solution that users will love. In response, our foundation team designed and rolled out a new system that reduces deployment time by 80% and eliminates wait time while also making it safer.</p>
              <p>In this session, I'll talk specifically about how we broke our monolithic application into multiple, smaller services allowing simultaneous deployments and nearly instantaneous rollbacks when necessary. I’ll also detail the technologies we rely on, the components we built ourselves, and the challenges we encountered along the way so you can learn from our missteps.

            <div class="schedule-abstract">
              <p>I often ask myself these questions: Will this code be easy for the others to edit? Does it scale? Can I forget it and change it later without being lost?</p>
              <p>While Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS (SMACSS) is just one methodology, the principals of modular CSS are applicable to sites large and small. Using a modular approach in tandem with Sass can greatly improve development efficiency and project maintenance. I'll discuss specific techniques, such as selector inheritance and interpolation, that can greatly reduce the amount of code written. Your code will be more portable, making it easier to use code on other projects.</p>

            <div class="schedule-abstract">
              <p>We don't like testing CRUD APIs, but if we must, we generate them! In this talk, I’ll cover writing generators that produce test requests and responses based on data-types we're familiar with, such as Ints, Strings, Maps, Keywords, as well as on custom types that reflect our domain (e.g. county-codes, email-addresses, partial-required's). I'll focus on how we implement Clojure's test.check, a property-based testing tool inspired by <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/john-hughes/quick.pdf">QuickCheck</a> to produce randomized data for changing and newly-created inputs, as well as simulating requests with dynamic parameters (e.g. for search or collection filtering).</p>
              <p>You’ll learn about converting <a href="https://github.com/prismatic/schema">Prismatic schema</a> validation maps into variable sample data by way of injecting constraints and composing the results of basic generators with more novel ones throughout the test-generation process. I will show examples that demonstrate how granular these property-tests can become and how easily we can automate an exhausting, data-specific process.</p>

            <div class="schedule-abstract">
              <p>"Microservice" is a term that has started popping up as a way to describe loosely coupled systems made of many small applications. While the general ideas of SOA aren't new, recent activity has pushed them towards ever smaller services with smaller, simpler interfaces—often JSON over HTTP in the REST or hypermedia model.</p>
              <p>This talk will cover best practices for building microclients for these microservices, focusing in particular on leveraging the hypermedia model and some of the neglected parts of REST. The examples for this talk will be in Ruby, but the design principles are widely applicable, and HTTP is HTTP no matter where you program.</p>
              <p>Writing servers is only half the battle to make the microservice model work. We need great clients too.</p>

              <p>President John F. Kennedy was a visionary. In 1962, he proposed the seemingly impossible challenge of walking on the Moon. On July 20, 1969, that challenge became a reality. It was a moment in our history that propelled us into moving beyond our self-imposed limitations of what we, as human beings, are capable of doing.</p>
              <p>Today, we see how this vision of space travel has affected our love and work on technology. Our multiple devices and subscriptions guide us through our daily lives, which has changed the way we see our world.</p>
              <p>But how does this love for technology propel us forward to solve the most difficult problems we face as a society: ever growing issues, such as hunger, poverty, climate change, social inequality and injustice?</p>
              <p>This talk reflects upon where we are as technologists, where we have been and how we can start focusing again on solving hard problems. We’ll go over ways attendees can contribute their talents, gifts and ideas to varying initiatives around the globe which are taking on these challenging issues.</p>

              <p>Rule engines draw love-or-hate reactions. They can simplify the expression of arbitrary business rules, but run into limits when more sophisticated logic is needed. While we can also author such logic in a general purpose language, even good functional or object-oriented practices get bogged down when sharing lots of frequently changing and intermingled data. This talk attempts to address the problem by viewing rules as a type of control structure.</p>
              <p>Rather than authoring rules in a limited mini language, we approach business logic declaratively in a host language with all language features available when needed. We’ll show how this can simplify logic for many problems, untangling tightly coupled functions into independent rules. From there we demonstrate Clara, an implementation of this pattern in Clojure. Finally, we’ll show how this enables visualization of our business logic for review and refinement by domain experts.</p>

              <p>Erlang is a great language to implement concurrent software. Its actor model provides strong data isolation guarantees and immutable data structures makes reasoning about concurrency easier.</p>
              <p>In this talk, we will explore Erlang's concurrency model in the context of a game engine that simulates trading commodities among players. The talk will include a quick introduction to Erlang syntax and the decomposition of the game nouns into Erlang processes. We will then demonstrate how Erlang's message passing, fault tolerance and process isolation features provide an ideal implementation language for massively concurrent software.</p>

              <p>Most of our code runs in a world where we don’t have to care too much about the number of bits a piece of data consumes, so we favor open and common data formats such as JSON or Protocol Buffers. However, when memory is constrained, such as on embedded systems, we can beat the system and achieve significant compression by understanding the nature of the data we are consuming. This talk will cover techniques and approaches to squeeze every last bit out of a dataset. It will touch on some concepts from information theory as well as some established general compression algorithms.</p>

            <div class="schedule-abstract">
              <p>TDD leads to better production code, but it has its limitations. We can only write so many tests, and the more tests we maintain, the more tests we change with new requirements. Can we do better? I say yes. Property-based testing is a technique out of functional programming, one that works in any language. In this talk, I’ll use examples in ScalaCheck to demonstrate principles everyone can use: generation of every possible input, calculation of satisfactory output, and automation of hundreds of checks in a single test case. Property-based testing is much harder than the example-based tests we’re used to. That’s the point: compel us to think harder about the problem, leading to better production code. Come see how property-based testing can press you and your code to higher levels of correctness and simplicity.</p>

              <p>The weather is everywhere and always. That makes for a lot of data. This talk will walk you through how you can use MongoDB to store and analyze worldwide weather data from the entire 20th century in a graphical application. MongoDB natively supports geospatial indexing and querying, enabling you to build applications that are location-aware. In the most recent release of MongoDB, there have been significant enhancements to the geospatial indexing capabilities in MongoDB, such as polygon intersections, a more accurate spherical model, and better integration with MongoDB's Aggregation Framework. In this presentation, you'll learn about the new enhancements and how they can be useful in the analysis of weather data. Learn how to ask and answer questions about capacity planning and scaling for both real-time and ad-hoc operations when dealing with huge datasets.</p>

              <p>In any given day, you likely carry your pocket computer (AKA "smartphone") within wireless range of hundreds of other pocket computers. In schools all over the US, students are sending an unrelenting stream of instant messages to each other while sitting in dense networks of little wireless devices. Yet we continue to rely on cellular towers, WiFi access points, and the Internet to transmit messages for us while we are actually closer to the destination than they are!</p>
              <p>Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) consist of many devices moving around and communicating with and through each other, without any predetermined infrastructure. While MANETs have been a research topic since the 1970s, much of the research has focused on the networking piece: basically the transport layer protocols and below. Much less attention has been given to creating and supporting applications for these networks, yet killer applications drive adoption!</p>
              <p>This talk will briefly describe MANETs, but focus mostly on MANET application development: the challenges, the potential solutions, and the very promising - and very near - future. MANETs are ready to break though to the mainstream. Will you be ready?</p>
